# Lazy Angular

This repository contains a demo application generated with the Yeoman Angular RequireJS generator and adapted to implement a lazy loading approach and feature-based organization of the codebase and Angular modules.

More can be found on the corresponding [blog post](http://juristr.com/blog/2014/07/lazy-angular-modules/). _(I'm about to finish every detail, so keep an eye on it)_

## Running the demo

Simply clone the repository, then execute a 

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

After having all dependencies loaded execute

```
$ grunt serve
```

to launch a local server that delivers the app.

# Contribute, suggestions..

These are really my first steps in learning Angular and building applications with it. So I'm more than happy for comments, suggestions or even contributions on how my approach could be improved.
