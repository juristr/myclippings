Kindle Clippings
====

Personal project that aims to create a web based application for managing my kindle clippings in a more user friendly way.  
_(At the same time it functions for me as a project for experimenting with some web technologies. Let's see where I can get this after-work project...)_

## Run it

Clone the repo, then enter the `server` directory and execute

```
$ npm install
```

## Execute the tests

Executing `grunt watch` will automatically execute the Mocha tests upon file changes. Otherwise execute `grunt mochaTest` for executing the tests a single time.

## Contributions

Would be really cool to get some contributions as well, but as of now the project is really just a couple of files. Still, feel free to [ping me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/juristr).
